                    <h2>What is "Terra Incognita"?</h2>

                    <p>In early human history large regions of the world laid largely unmapped
                        and these lands were labelled "Terra Incognita", translated, "unknown land".
                        These wild lands lured humankind to make the journey into them, somewhat blindly,
                        motivated by the thrill of exploration, dreams of great discovery and the desire to see
                        conquer what lay beyond. Since early recorded history rumors of what lived in these
                        open lands was not beyond fantasical notions, and the same lands labelled "Terra Incognita",
                        in urban legend may also have been labelled "Here be dragons". Today, we who created Bubl
                        believe that these early explorers would likely have been comforted in having a little bit more
                        information about the lands
                        they were travelling into, their fears of dragons quenched (or not!), locations of safe places
                        to stay the night, and some insights into other tribes that lay within the boundaries they
                        were embarking into.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our development team is made up entirely of ex-junior high students who transitioned from junior
                        high into
                        our own "Terra Incognita" - highschool lands of mostly uncharted territory. We have heard the
                        rumors
                        about dragons, and navigated them. Like the early explorers who steeled themselves
                        into unknown
                        lands we too have traveled the halls of our schools, mapping them in our minds by our own
                        experiences. We have known what it is like to explore a new place, and not know where
                        your friends are or where you might belong.
                    </p>

                    <p>Bubls mission is to help you connect with like-minded friends and begin building relationships
                        you can trust before you even begin your own journey into the halls of your highschool. To help
                        you
                        find your tribe and chart some landmarks for your map as you begin your own journey
                        into your own
                        "Terra Incognita". It's as easy as finding your school, searching for a Bubl of other
                        students that share your interests and joining their Bubl!</p>
