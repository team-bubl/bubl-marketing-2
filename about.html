                    <h1>Terra Incognita</h1>

                    <p>Since early recorded history humankind has understood both the intrigue but also the inherent
                        fears rooted in unknown territory. First seen in Ptolemy's Geography circa 150 and later
                        introduced
                        again in the 15th century, the term "Terra Incognita" can be translated as "unknown land".
                        Originally used
                        in early cartography for regions not yet mapped, urban legend claims such regions were also
                        labelled with
                        the phrase "Here be dragons". Only one surviving map substantiates that legend, but ancient
                        Roman and Medieval
                        cartographers were well known to use the phrase "HIC SVNT LEONES" on their own maps - "Here are
                        Lions".
                    </p>
                    <p>Our development team is made up entirely of ex-junior high students who transitioned from junior
                        high into
                        our own "Terra Incognita". Highschool Lands full of uncharted territory. We have heard the
                        stories
                        about Dragons and Lions, and navigated them. Like the early explorers who steeled themselves
                        into unknown
                        lands we too have traveled the halls of our schools, mapping them in our minds by our own
                        experiences.
